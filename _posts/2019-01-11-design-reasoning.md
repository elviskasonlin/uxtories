## Front Canards
- Provide stability on the longitudinal stability
- On surface it enables front to lift higher out of the water to reduce drag on the body minimising skin friction and frontal area.
- Provides better longitudinal stability by increasing the area the wings have to push on when rolling


## Adjustable Canards
- It provides the front wing the appropriate down force or lift when required during the forward movement of the craft.
- It also enables easy tuning to correct roll and pitch

## Aluminium motor mounts
- Use of aluminum to increase weight
- Keep the center of gravity relatively in the center of the craft
- Help to increase the overall density of the craft to be denser than water.
- Provides better longitudinal stability by increasing the area the wings have to push on when rolling
- From our seniors experiences of using 3d printed motor mounts, it would break oftenly thus to avoid it aluminum will be a more reliable choice of material.

## Weight below craft
- Helps to increase weight thus increasing overall density allowing the submarine to sink
- It also helps with lowering the center of gravity of the submarine thus giving it a self correcting tendency allowing it to stay upright better in the water

## Usage of zip ties
- Use of 3d printed motor mounts, would break frequently
- Use of zip ties as a replacement mounting system as it is easily replaceable
- More reliable choice of material.

## Back center motor
- The 350 GPH motors are too weak for efficient forward operations
- Use a more powerful 1100 GPH motor to assist the forward thrust

## Lock and lock container
- It enables easy accessibility of the electronics of the craft.
- It also has a significant portion which is above the craft thus increasing stability by having the buoyancy of the craft “pulling upwards” and with the weight of the overall craft “pulling downwards”
- This combined together helps to create a self correcting property allowing it to stay up-right.
