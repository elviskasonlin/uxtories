The product was finally ready and underwent final testing in the 12th of February 2019. As seen in the images above, the final product is an economical, tethered, neutrally buoyant craft able to achieve approximately one m/s speeds for straights and a depth of at least one meter. The craft is also able to provide a relatively clear out signal from its cameras albeit with a lot a noise. No other data output devices, such as pH sensors, were installed due to insufficient time. <br/><br/>I should be noted that in its current incarnation, the craft has a few drawbacks with the most glaring issues being the potential to get caught on its own tether, and usage of two copper strip board tracks for high current use thereby limiting its duration of usage. Additionally, the craft is also using linear voltage regulators from the 78XX series instead of buck converters due to time constraints and spoilt parts which led to a total of 11Vs being wasted as heat thereby also limiting usage duration. For a prototype, the craft works sufficiently.
