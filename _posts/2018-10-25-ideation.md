We aimed to settle the final idea by the end of week 2. There were a _few ideas thrown around initially_. A few of them being :
* A sensor platform on water that moves from point A to B via flight (essentially a drone that floats on water and collects environmental data)
* A mesh network of environmental sensors deployed far apart at sea.
* Turbidity and water quality sensors for fisheries.
* An amphibious vehicle (a hovercraft for example) that is able to take a variety of sensor readings.
* Oil slick cleaner/clean-up material set-up
* Underwater structural inspection vehicle
* RC firefighting vehicle
* Surveillance submersible vehicle
* Coral reef inspection
* Algae clean-up vehicle

However, the *final idea* incorporates quite a few ideas listed previously into one. It is a modular mobile sensor platform that is able to change its functionality easily by swapping individual sensor blocks. Sensors may potentially include the following :
* Structural damage inspection
* Environmental sensors air (humidity, pressure, temperature)
* Environmental sensors water (turbidity, pH)
* Automated surveillance
