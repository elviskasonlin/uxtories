# Areas for improvement overview
There were a few significant areas for improvement. They are, namely, power distribution, construction, and lighting.

# Power distribution
The current power distribution design causes a high current to flow through the power distribution copper strip board, resulting in a burn out everytime the ROV runs. See the image below for more details. This problem can be mitigated by having a thicker conducting material such as a completely different wire that can be tapped out for further processing. Addtionally, a working buck converter will be a more efficient method that generates less heat as compared to the linear voltage regulators currently used to drop the voltage.

Additionally, in order to reduce the number of wires used for sending signals to the buoy above, a common ground can be established through a metal body or object running through the entire length of the ROV.

# Construction
Additional holes can be placed at both ends of the ROV hull in order to facilitate a faster movement of trapped air at any angle of tilt.

# Lighting
Current lighting system, due to the lack of time, has been placed at a less than optimal area below the camera dome. This causes a flaring for the camera which is undesirable. Adding a housing that creates a directional light can be used to mitigate this problem.
