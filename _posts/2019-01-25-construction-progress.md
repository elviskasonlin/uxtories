# Mechanical
The craft slowly took shape with a large PVC pipe cut to fit in an electronics compartment. Wiring, sealing, and waterproofing was also done to various components including the camera housing and wiring inserts. Motors were attached and mounted; some directly to the hull and others onto the two wings created with bent metal. 

# Electrical
Meanwhile while this is going on, on the electrical side, testing was done on the PS2 signal receiving distances, different motor shields, and cables. Programming of the propulsion system was also being completed during this phase.
