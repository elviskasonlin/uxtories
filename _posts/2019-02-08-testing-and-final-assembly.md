# Final Assembly & Testing
In order to ensure that water does not enter into the main electronics compartment, grease was applied around the lip of the lock & lock box. This step would not have be required if not for an accident to the structural integrity of the box. The boat was then tested at the swimming pool to check for its operational status regarding the program after fixing the direction and wiring issues previously present. Besides that, it was also used to check if there were leakage in the boat so that we are able to patch it up and prevent water from seeping. 

This was where the craft was tested freely together with the buoy in water whereas previously, the buoy was on land. During this testing, a few issues flared up. Firstly, the tracks on the copper strip board as well as the voltage regulators could not handle high currents for a prolonged period of time. Secondly, the tether can potentially get caught on the open propellers. And finally, the video signals suffer from interference from other components. Apart from these glaring issues, the craft was operable.
