# Power draw

*The maximum current of 15.69 A refers to the maximum current drawn by the entire system, assuming everything is switched on with all 4 motors are stalling.

# Under normal circumstances
Based from the average ampere each component consumes (3rd Column),
Total amperage draw = (1.5 x 2) + (3 x 2) + (0.3 x 2) + 0.4 + 0.03 + 0.07 = 10.1A 

Batteries given: 3S 11.1V, 2250mAh (2.2A) , 25Wh, 45C (99A max discharge)
Therefore, run time of the entire craft is:
(2.2/10.1) x 60 = 13.1 mins

Given that under normal circumstances, the craft can run for 13.1 mins before the battery must be recharged.

# Under maximum circumstances
If the watercraft is running at overload current, from the table, the craft draws about 15.1A.

Batteries given: 3S 11.1V, 2250mAh (2.2A) , 25Wh, 45C (99A max discharge)
Therefore, run time of the entire craft is:
(2.2/15.1) x 60 = 8.7 mins

So this means that the minimum time the craft should run for is 8.7 mins.
