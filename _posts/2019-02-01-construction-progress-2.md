# Electrical
On electrical side of things, an acrylic mounting board for microcontrollers and motor shields was laser cut and assembled in order to set up an organised wiring environment with easy troubleshooting access. However, due to estimation errors on the available space, the board ended up only barely fitting inside the electronics compartment. Later, an executive decision was made to forgo the mounting board layout in favour of a simpler, free form layout. The first image shows the original mounting designs while the second shows the optimised variation currently being used inside the craft.

The balancing of the buoyant force was done by a careful insertion of weights and foam around the front and the back of the craft instead of an electronic compressed air system. A 5W LED later added to the front of the craft by attaching it to the weights below.

The video camera circuit was also connected to the receiver on the buoy via the tether. The reason why both the signal transmitter and receivers are not under water is primarly due to signal penetration issues given our current transmitter/receiver power. This can be seen in the diagram below. <br /><br /><img src="/speaalpha18/asset_images/diagrams/sigloss.jpeg"/><br />

# Mechanical
Fins and mounts were 3D printed, to be the link between our parts and the submersible ROV. Wings and the weights adapter all being 3D printed to enable easy adjustment of the boat's buoyancy. Depending on the side the boat tilts, counterweights were added to balance it off. We used epoxy to try and seal up the contact between the contacts lock and lock box and the PVC pipe.
